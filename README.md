# Web Phishing Detection

## Objective:


Phishing attack is used to steal confidential information of a user. Fraud websites appears like genuine websites with the logo and graphics of genuine website. This project aims to detect fraud or phishing website using machine learning techniques.
Phishing website is one of the internet security problems that target the human vulnerabilities rather than software vulnerabilities. It can be described as the process of attracting online users to obtain their sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models and deep neural networks on the dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and legitimate URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measured and compared.


## Model Building:

The Dataset used for the Model building Phase are inserted in the Dataset collection.The dataset are Collected From the various platform.In this Process we are using Various Datasets For Testing And Training  the Machine Learning algorithm to find the which has the Most occuracy.
